# Security & Backup Strategy for QNOVA VR

## SSL/HTTPS:
✅ SSL certificate (automatic with Vercel/Railway)
✅ Force HTTPS redirects
✅ HSTS headers
✅ Secure cookies

## Environment Security:
✅ Environment variables (no secrets in code)
✅ Database connection encryption
✅ CORS configuration for allowed origins
✅ Rate limiting on API endpoints

## Database Security:
✅ MongoDB Atlas encryption at rest
✅ Network access restrictions
✅ Database user permissions (principle of least privilege)
✅ Regular password rotation

## Backup Strategy:
1. **Database Backups**:
   - MongoDB Atlas: Automatic continuous backups
   - Point-in-time recovery available
   - Cross-region backup storage

2. **Code Backups**:
   - GitHub repository (primary)
   - Multiple contributor access
   - Protected main branch

3. **Configuration Backups**:
   - Environment variables documented
   - Deployment configurations in repository
   - DNS settings documented

## Disaster Recovery Plan:
1. **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 30 minutes
2. **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 1 hour
3. **Emergency contacts**: Owner + technical contact
4. **Backup deployment**: Secondary cloud provider ready

## Security Monitoring:
- Failed login attempts
- Unusual booking patterns
- API abuse detection
- Certificate expiration alerts
