The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a basic QNOVA VR MVP into a feature-rich, professional website. Key efforts included extensive debugging, particularly fixing  component duplication and persistent backend deployment issues related to MongoDB connection strings and erroneous  entries. The engineer meticulously improved UI/UX, implementing smooth mobile responsiveness and dynamic animations. Significant value was added through multilingual support, a new pricing page, and a completely redesigned homepage integrating KAT VR technology, featured games, and a YouTube video. The work demonstrates an iterative approach, focusing on user feedback, resolving critical bugs, and progressively enhancing core functionality and design.

<product_requirements>
The user initially required a professional website for QNOVA VR, a VR studio in GÃ¶ttingen, to showcase services, a game catalog, facilitate online bookings, and provide contact information. The design was to be black-and-white minimalist, VR-focused, modern, clean, and easy to navigate. Key sections included Home, About Us, Services, Game Catalog, Online Booking, and Contact. Technical requirements included full responsiveness, fast loading, multilingual support (German, English, Russian), and eventual CMS/SEO optimization. Iterative updates focused on adding precise contact info, email notifications for bookings, expanding multilingual support, and enhancing UI/UX (e.g., burger menu auto-close, professional footer, dynamic animations). The application now supports full trilingual content, has a functional booking system (after significant debugging), a detailed pricing page, and a comprehensively redesigned homepage featuring KAT VR details, popular games, and an embedded promotional video.
