The previous AI engineer effectively established a fully functional MVP for QNOVA VR, demonstrating an iterative, feature-driven development approach. The initial focus was on rapid delivery of core functionalities, including a comprehensive website structure, online booking system, and contact integration. The engineer diligently addressed user feedback, adding multilingual support (German, English, Russian), fixing contact details, implementing robust email notifications, and enhancing UI/UX with responsive design and dynamic animations. A significant portion of the work involved debugging email authentication (Gmail SMTP) and frontend responsiveness (burger menu display), showcasing persistent problem-solving. The engineer leveraged  for initial setup and then  for incremental updates, consistently testing changes.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, utilizing MongoDB for data storage.



-   ****:
    *   **Importance:** This file serves as the core of the FastAPI backend. It defines API endpoints, handles business logic, and interacts with the MongoDB database for booking management. It also contains the email notification logic.
    *   **Changes:**
        *   Initial creation for booking (POST /api/bookings) and potentially other sections like game catalog data.
        *   Integration of  for environment variables (, , ).
        *   Implementation of MongoDB connection and CRUD operations for bookings.
        *   Integration of email sending logic (using  for Gmail SMTP) for both studio owner notifications and customer confirmations.
        *   Updates to handle different languages for customer confirmation emails (German).
        *   Debugging and error logging for Gmail authentication issues, showing booking details in logs when email fails.

-   ****:
    *   **Importance:** This is the main React component, serving as the application's entry point and housing the routing logic. It orchestrates the display of different website sections and manages global states like language.
    *   **Changes:**
        *   Initial setup of React application with routes for Home, About, Services, Game Catalog, Online Booking, and Contact.
        *   Integration of Tailwind CSS for styling and responsiveness.
        *   Implementation of the language context () and a  hook for multi-language support (German, English, Russian).
        *   Addition of header navigation with language toggle and mobile burger menu functionality.
        *   Integration of  components using  for scroll-triggered animations (fadeInUp, slideInLeft, etc.) to various content sections.
        *   Inclusion of the new  component, ensuring it renders on all pages.
        *   Refinements to mobile burger menu to auto-close on link clicks and language toggles.

-   ****:
    *   **Importance:** Contains global CSS styles and keyframe definitions for animations.
    *   **Changes:** Addition of  for various animation effects (e.g., , , , ). Definition of animation utility classes used by .

-   ****:
    *   **Importance:** Configures Tailwind CSS, including breakpoints and custom utilities.
    *   **Changes:** Modified responsive breakpoints (e.g., , , ) in attempts to correctly display the mobile burger menu at various screen sizes.

-   ****:
    *   **Importance:** This file serves as the log for testing outcomes, particularly for backend and frontend tests performed by automated agents.
    *   **Changes:** Updated frequently with summaries of backend API tests (booking creation, email integration) and frontend UI tests (responsiveness, functionality). It tracks the overall progress and highlights remaining issues.

<pending_tasks>
-   **CMS Integration (e.g., WordPress):** The initial requirements mentioned a CMS for self-management of games and updates. This has not yet been implemented.
-   **Online Payment Option:** The initial requirements listed online payment as an optional Phase Two feature.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on implementing dynamic visual enhancements and ensuring full responsiveness.
The website now features a comprehensive animation system:
*   CSS keyframe animations (, , , , , , , ) have been integrated.
*   React components wrap sections to trigger these animations using an  when elements scroll into view, creating smooth slide-in and fade effects.
*   Staggered animations are used for sequential element appearance in sections like the hero banner.

The website also has full trilingual support (German, English, Russian) implemented across the navigation, main content, and the newly added footer. Language switching is done via a toggle button, instantly updating all visible text.

The mobile burger menu was updated to auto-close when a navigation link or the language toggle is clicked, improving the user experience. However, a specific issue with the mobile menu's *visibility* and *responsive breakpoints* was identified. Despite attempts to adjust Tailwind breakpoints (, , ), the desktop navigation was still appearing on mobile/tablet viewports, and the burger menu icon was not visible or triggering correctly at smaller screen sizes. The AI engineer acknowledged this persistent responsive design flaw at the end of the trajectory.
